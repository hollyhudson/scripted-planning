## Intro

#### What does javascript let you do?
* make websites respond to users
* build apps and games
* access information from databases
* present data

#### Quick aside:  What's a database?

A collection of data, like all the addresses of your customers,
that you have stored all together in a "database".  "Accessing"
data means to get data out of the database.

Go here:  

* Start the lesson
* When it prompts you, sign up for an account (we won't finish today, but if you have an account you can pick up where you left off).
* Stop when you get to _Mid Lesson Breather_

```
Here's the order and content of the codecademy tutorial:

* "yourName".length
* basic math
* undefined word
* comments
* confirm("string"); // popup
* prompt("question"); // popup
* datatypes:
	* numbers
	* strings
* booleans and comparison operator
* console.log()
* more comparison operators ( >, <, <=, >=, ===, !== )
* if statements
* if else statements
* fix the bugs in the code exercise
* __Mid Lesson breather__
```

#### Review afterwards:

* what is a string?
	* a "string" of letters
	* we call letters "characters", sometimes abbrev. as "char"
* what is a data type?
	* the type of information you're working with
* what are some types of data?
	* string (string of letters)
	* number (something you can do math with)
	* boolean (true vs. false, sometimes 1 vs. 0)
* why do we care about data types?
	* In the olden days, memory was scarce so you had to tell
	the computer how big your data was so it wouldn't set aside
	more space than necessary.  Languages used to have a lot
	of data types for all the different sizes of data (small
	numbers vs. really big numbers).  Today computers have more
	storage, so many languages only use a few data types.
	However, sometimes we still use little compters with limited
	storage (show microcontroller), so we still use languages
	that allow you to use lots of different data types.
	* javascript isn't designed to be careful about storage,
	so instead its data types are used to let the computer
	know what it can do with the data.  For instance, you can
	add 3 and 4, but can you add ice and dragon? (actually you
	can, but you do it differently for strings than for numbers,
	give example).
		* example idea, (fire, ice, thunder) + (dragon,
		unicorn, ninja), where you can make icedragon, or
		fireunicorn, or something.
	* bare numbers are treated like numbers
	* anything in quotes, including a number, is treated as a string
	* Is it a number or a string?  "kitten", 8, 203.49, "number", 32/8, "42", puppy
* what does console.log() do?
	* prints to the console (show where that is in slide)
	* use it for debugging (we'll discuss this in a bit)
* name some comparison operators
	* why 3 equals signs?
	* What is "!" called? bang!  What does it mean?  NOT!
* write down what an "if statement" looks like.  do you remember the syntax?
	* most programming languages have lots of similiarities, like most have if statements. If you forget the syntax for the language you're using, you can just google it.  "if statement javascript" or "conditionals javascri or "conditionals javascri or "conditionals javascript".  Get used to building these outlines in your mind.  It's good to try to remember the outline of the syntax so you don't have to keep looking it up all the time.

## Back to codecademy:

```
Order and content of remaining tutorial:

* if/else review
* modulo
* substrings
* using substrings in console.log (nesting parentheses)
* variables
* variable practice with length and substring()
* review
* if/else practice
```

#### Review:

* What is modulo?
* What are two things you can do with a string?
	* find the length
	* select a substring
* Why would you use a variable?
	* what does it mean to "declare" a variable?
	* how many times do you declare a variable?
	* what is the "value" of a variable?
	* what do you do if you want to change the value of a variable?
* Sometimes there's quotation marks, and sometimes there isn't, why?
	* `console.log("Holly");` vs. `console.log(myName);`
